# Assignment
OOP Assignment

My project is based around road deaths between the years 1961-2007. I acquired this data set off the 'An Garda SÃ­ochana' (http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=10717&Lang=1). I chose this data set, even though it is quite a serious a grim topic, as the reality of these deaths should be expressed as greatly as possible to the public. The relaity is deaths on our roads is on the rise due to many factors. The one factor that i will concentrate on is drink driving which causes a huge amount of deaths on our road. I will use a simple line graph to illustrate the fluctuation of deaths on our roads and my own visualisation to illustrate the affects alcohol has on your driving ability. 

I plan to collect more information on drink driving deaths to help with my visualisation and possibily gather another data set. I will use the data set I have to illustrate a simple line graph and use the data collected to calculate average, max and min deaths on the road for both careless and drink driving. I plan on alos comparing graphs by using correlation. I will apply a menu to allow the user to pick the various information i will have to offer.Most importantly i willuse this assignment to test my abilities in processing to create striking visualisations and other aspects of coding i am not familiar with yet.

In my progression through this assignment i implemented the use of classes and controlp5 for my menu. I also tested my ability to create different graphs.

This shows the use of a bar chart used to display the data of deaths caused by drink driving between 1961 and 2007. It also displays the min and max values.

This shows the use of a line graph to illustrate general road deaths between 1961 and 2007. It also displays the min and max values but allows the user to see each years deaths by interacting with the screen.

![correlation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15383888/11634825/c1e98c66-9d0a-11e5-9f06-f0bea0bf8aa2.jpg)

This shows the correlation between both graphs and again allows the user to interact by seeing each years deaths.

Although it is a haunting data set i hope if it is viewed it will show the seriousness of drink driving as there are too many deaths caused by poor driving and substance abuse!
